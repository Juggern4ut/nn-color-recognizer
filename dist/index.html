      <h1>Guessing the Unseen</h1>
      <h2>Using Neural Networks to Predict Color Complements</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The system is able to generate a random color which is passed to an neural network. The network will then try
          to guess the complementary color and return it.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve the best possible result the network is trained with the perfect complement that is mathematically
          calculated.

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes it is difficult to find a fitting color to a given palette. It is important that the color looks
          appealing and fits the overall theme. This project is only a simple demonstration but shows that with enough
          training a network could be setup to generate well recieved color pallettes.

        <h3>Demonstration</h3>
        <p>A neural network tries to find the complement for a given color.</p>
        <p>
          By clicking the 'Test neural network' button, a new random color will be generated and applied to the
          background. The big box in the middle labeled 'Prediction' is the guess of the neural network. The smaller box
          below shows the perfect complement. The closer those two are together, the better the neural network has been
          trained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking the 'Train'-Button will train the neural network with 500 random colors and their perfect complement.
          The more training sessions are done, the smaller the error margin should become.
